# MicroPython Drivers Collection

This repository contains all of my **MicroPython drivers** for different hardware components and modules.  
It serves as a central place to organize, test, and reuse drivers across various embedded and robotics projects.

---

## Contents
- Drivers for sensors, actuators, and controllers
- Example code snippets for testing and validation
- Organized by hardware type (motors, displays, comms, etc.)

---

## Purpose
- Provide reusable building blocks for MicroPython projects  
- Speed up development by keeping tested drivers in one place  
- Share with others who want to use or adapt these drivers  

---

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Copy the required driver file(s) into your project folder.
3. Import the driver in your MicroPython script and initialize it with your hardware settings.
